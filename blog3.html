        Inspired by Miyawaki’s technique, I decided to turn a small part of my backyard into a mini forest. With a mix of native trees, bushes, and flowering plants, I’ve been able to create a dense, self-sustaining ecosystem in less than two years. It’s now home to various birds, butterflies, and even squirrels.

    <h3>Tips for Creating Your Own Mini Forest:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick a variety of native plants and trees that support biodiversity.</li>
        <li>Plant them densely to create a natural, forest-like growth pattern.</li>
        <li>Let nature take its course – avoid unnecessary pruning or maintenance. Let it grow wild!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This small forest in my backyard is now my sanctuary. It's proof that even small urban spaces can contribute to afforestation and biodiversity.</p>
